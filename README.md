# InspectAI

InspectAI is an experimental project aimed at building an **AI-powered code review assistant**.  
The goal is to integrate **AI models + static analysis + Jira** to help developers catch issues early, reduce CI/CD failures, and make reviews more efficient.  

## Idea
- Use **AI models** (e.g., CodeT5, GPT-based) to generate human-like review comments.  
- Combine with **static analysis tools** (flake8, pylint) for rule-based checks.  
- Integrate with **Jira** to automatically log and track critical issues.  
- Learn continuously from developer feedback (accept/reject suggestions).  

## Current Status
This project is in its **early planning phase**.  
Right now, we are:  
- Collecting research papers and datasets.  
- Designing the initial architecture.  
- Exploring Jira API and GitHub Actions for integration.  

##  Tech (Planned)
- **Language**: Python 3.10+  
- **ML/AI**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **API**: FastAPI  
- **Static Analysis**: flake8, pylint  
- **Integration**: Jira API
